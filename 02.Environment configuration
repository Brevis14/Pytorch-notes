# 🚀 Fixing Common PyTorch + CUDA Setup Issues (with Python 3.13 Heads-Up)

While trying to set up PyTorch with CUDA support, especially under a Conda virtual environment and using tools like PyCharm, you might hit errors like:

### ❌ Common Errors

```bash
1. PyCharm cannot detect the Conda environment or the interpreter in it.
2. Invalid Python interpreter.
3. C:\Users\Users_name\.conda\envs\venv_name\python.exe: can't open file 'c:\\Users\\Users_name\\Desktop\\info': [Errno 2] No such file or directory
4. >>> print(torch.cuda.is_available())
   >>> False
These errors often occur due to version mismatches between Python, PyTorch, and CUDA, especially if you're using bleeding-edge Python versions (like 3.13), which are not yet supported by PyTorch as of now.

# ✅ Step-by-Step Fixes
1.Clean uninstall current (possibly CPU-only) PyTorch packages in your environment:
```bash
 pip uninstall torch torchvision torchaudio
2.Remove the problematic Conda environment:
```bash
 conda env remove --name pytorch
3.Downgrade to Python 3.11 (PyTorch-supported version) by creating a fresh Conda environment with a PyTorch-supported Python version (recommended: Python 3.11):
```bash
 conda create -n pytorch python=3.11
4.Install PyTorch with CUDA 12.1 support using the official PyTorch wheel source:
```bash
 pip install torch==2.5.1+cu121 torchvision==0.20.1+cu121 torchaudio==2.5.1+cu121 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121
5.Verify that CUDA is working:
  >>> import torch
  >>> print(torch.cuda.is_available()) # Should print: True

#### 📝 Notes:
May not work for everyone,but it’s a good baseline if you're facing similar headaches.
#### 💡 Tip
If you’re using PyCharm, don’t forget to manually point your project interpreter to the Conda environment you just created (pytorch), via:
```bash
Settings → Project → Python Interpreter → Add → Conda Environment → Existing
